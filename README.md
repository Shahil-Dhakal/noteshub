# Noteshub
__Noteshub__ is a simple college project started by a group of freshers to have a convenient way to manage and share notes.

As can be seen, the project has just been started and we're adding stuff to it as we learn.

+ The current objective of the project is:
    - to have a system where user can login, register and also upload their own content.
    - to have a page where users can view recent uploads (similar to a blog application) and download the files if provided on that post.

We are planning to group the notes based on the subjects and maybe, <i>in the future</i>, also based on semester.
